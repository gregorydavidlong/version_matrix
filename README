== Running the tests

There are Cucumber and Rspec tests for the Version Matrix application. The general philosphy is to have Cucumber tests for testing use cases, and rspec tests for the controllers and models.

First you need to set-up the database. The following commands will get the development and test database schemas set-up:
 - rake db:migrate
 - rake environment RAILS_ENV=test db:migrate

The Cucumber tests can be run with the following command:
 - bundle exec cucumber

The rspec unit tests can be run with the following command:
 - bundle exec rspec spec/
